    <h1>Welcome to CJ's Homepage</h1>
    <p>We are now at the second month of our StackTrek Full Stack Bootcamp. I will be honest, the more we progress, the more complex and "mind-crunching" the concepts had become. I am not complaining though. Why? It's because these "concepts" and new topics are necessary and would actually make everything simplier in the long process. I am also very grateful to our instructions and trainers for their patience, guidance, and insights towards our journey. Without them, certainly everything would be much harder to grasp. One thing I can say now is that even though the technologies and concepts we are learning are getting complex as we progress, the fun of doing and applying these things are still and will always be there. To our wild success!</p>
