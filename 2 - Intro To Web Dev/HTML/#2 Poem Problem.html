        <h1>Trees</h1>
        <pre>
    I think that I shall never sweet
    A poem lovely as a tree.
        
    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
    Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;
        
    A tree that looks at God all day,
    And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
        
    A tree that may in Summer wear
    A nest of robins in her hair;
        
    Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
    Who intimately lives with rain.
        
    Poems are made by fools like me,
    But only God can make a tree.
